            My name is Jason Golliet, I was born in Oakland California but have been raised in Washington for most of my life. 
            <br>
            <br>
            I'm a student at Green River College, pursuing my Associates of Arts degree, as well as a student at University of Washington's Coding Bootcamp.
            <br>
            <br>
            I've been interested in technology since I was a little kid, building up and (mostly) tearing apart old radios, gameboys, and whatever else we had lying around the house.
            <br>
            <br>
            I want to explore a lot of different opportunities in the tech industry, but my initial passion lies with Software Development. I'd love to work at a start up company in the future where I can be an active member of my team.
            <br>
            <br>When I'm not dreaming about code, I'm enjoying my time at the gym or on the couch playing video games. I also love to get out enjoy time outside in the PNW!
